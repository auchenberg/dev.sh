  <p>Tired of adding entries to /etc/hosts? Ever wanted wildcard domains in your /etc/hosts?</p>
  <p><strong>dev</strong> solves all of that by installing a small dns server, and points all *.dev traffic to your computer.</p>

  <h2>Get started</h2>
  <p>To install simply open a terminal and run this command:</p>
  
  <div class="install">
    <span class="prefix">$</span>
    <input type="text" class="command" value="curl get.dev.sh | sh" />
    <span class="source">(<a href="http://get.dev.sh" target="_blank">View Source</a>)</span>
  </div>
  
  <h2>What's going on?</h2>
  <p><strong>dev</strong> is a small shell script that installs <a href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html" target="_blank">dnsmasq</a>, a lightweight DNS server, registeres it as a LaunchDaemon, so it start's when your computer boots, and configures Resolver in OSX to resolve *.dev traffic to dnsmasq. </p>That's it.</p>
